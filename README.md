## Postgres vs Elasticsearch for Full-Text Search

Postgres is a powerful relational database that can handle full-text search. However, Elasticsearch is a better choice for full-text search because it is designed for this purpose. Elasticsearch is a distributed search engine that can handle large amounts of data and is highly scalable. It is also faster than Postgres for full-text search.
