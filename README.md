# Elasticsearch with Django

This is a simple project to demonstrate how to use Elasticsearch with Django.

## What is Elasticsearch?
Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data, so you can discover the expected and uncover the unexpected.

* Open source project
* Developed in Java
* RESTful API
* Real-time search and analytics
* Distributed and scalable
* Highly available
* Multi-tenancy
* Full-text search
* Schema-free JSON documents
* Built on top of Apache Lucene


## Postgres vs Elasticsearch for Full-Text Search

Postgres is a powerful relational database that can handle full-text search. However, Elasticsearch is a better choice for full-text search because it is designed for this purpose. Elasticsearch is a distributed search engine that can handle large amounts of data and is highly scalable. It is also faster than Postgres for full-text search.
